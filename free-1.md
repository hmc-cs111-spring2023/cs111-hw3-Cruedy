# Free project 1

## The user and a language
### This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a good way to meet their needs.
_This project is for users who use apps from Adobe's Creative Cloud add want to program their own changes/extensions to applications in the suite. currently the suite allows for you to use javascript to make changes in after effects, which is a video editing software, but I think Adobe should have its own language which can be used for all of their software._

### What's the need?
### What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help them?
_This language would allow users to customize and personalize the creations they make through applications in the Adobe Suite. I would be helping video editors and graphic designers who want to user a DSL for their work. Javascript is available for video editors, but I think their could be a simpler language that is specifically for graphics and videos._

### Why a language?
### Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?
_Since the applications are made out of a general programming language, a DSL can be used to extend parts of the program so it can better fit their needs._

### Why you?
### What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?
_I use After Effects, which is a video editing software in the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, so I would be able to use this DSL. I use javascript to make changes in After Effects, but I feel like there could be a more intuitive language._

### Domain
### Describe the project's domain in five words.
_graphics, design, visuals, customize, and effects_

### Interface (syntax)
### How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?
_The user would be able to see the code that's already written for the effects they want to change, and inside the application they would be able to change the effect using pre-made functions and their own functions. The editor would be in teh applications that are being changed themselves. This is the easiest way to implement the language because you would be able to see the changes immediately._

### Operation (semantics)
### What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to the user?
_When a program runs, you would see the changes in the produced video or graphics. If there is an error(mostly syntax), the product just won't render._

### Expressiveness
### What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?
_It should be easy to write a function that performs an action once. I think looping is possible, but difficult. I don't think conditions are necessary, so it think they would be very difficult._

### Related work
### Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?
_There are already graphic DSLs like DOT and HTML. I think they only focus on graphics and not also videos.
[DOT website](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)
DOT is used for creating graphs.
[HTML website](https://ktor.io/docs/html-dsl.html)
HTML is used for designing websites.
Neither one of them are used for videos, so they don't fully address the need._

## The Project
### This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability
### If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g., making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot of language design)?
_I think that pretty much all of the time would be spent on working on language aspects because the system is very specific and is well organized already. Designing the language seems much more complex._

### Scope
### How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?
_I think that this idea is ambitious because I'm not fully sure how the Adobe software is made and what language would work with it._

### Benefits and drawbacks
### Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea for a project?
_This is a good idea because it has a practical use. It might be a bad idea because it seems complicated to implement._
